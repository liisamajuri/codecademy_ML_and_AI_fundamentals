# Final Portfolio Project: **_Oulu City Print Volumes_**

This project is part of _the Machine Learning/AI Fundamentals_ course and serves as the final portfolio project. The objective of this project is to analyze print volumes in the city of Oulu. The project involved selecting the topic, gathering the necessary data, performing the analysis using Jupyter Notebook, and sharing the results on GitHub for easy access and collaboration.

The main goal of the project is to practice the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and apply various techniques for data analysis. The focus is on generating analyzed data in both numerical and visual forms.

**NOTE!** _This project aims to provide processed data for an imaginary third party, rather than explaining the findings or interpreting the results._

The project includes the following steps:
- Data acquisition: Gathering the necessary data on print volumes in Oulu.
- Data preprocessing: Preparing and organizing the data for analysis.
- Data analysis: Calculating statistical key figures using pivot tables.
- Results presentation: Sharing the analysis results, including tables and visualizations, on GitHub for easy access and collaboration.
